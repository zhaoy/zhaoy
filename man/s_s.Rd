\usage{
s_s(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a data-frame, vector, factor, or one or more dates / date-times.}
}
\value{
A base-R data-frame with the following columns:

var: variable names, included only if \code{x} is a data-frame.

n_miss: numbers of missing data.

pct_miss: missing data as percents rounded to the nearest integers.

n_unique: numbers of unique values.

pct_unique: unique values as percents rounded to the nearest integers.

min, max, median, mean: if the variable is non-numeric, \code{\link{NA}} is returned.

mode: if \code{\link{NA}} is the most frequent value in the variable, \code{\link{NA}} or "<NA>" is returned.
If the variable has multiple modes, "> 1 mode" is returned.
If the variable has a length of one, or has otherwise no mode, "no mode" is returned.
